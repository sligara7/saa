## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The Wallet Security Service provides secure wallet import, key management, and transaction signing capabilities for all trading operations. It serves as the cryptographic foundation for the XRPL LP Optimization System.

### 1.2 Scope
- One-way secure wallet import
- Transaction signing and authorization
- HSM integration and key management
- Operation permissions control
- Cryptographic operations audit
- Regular key management and rotation
- Multi-signature transaction support

### 1.3 Security Principles
- One-way data flow (diode pattern)
- No wallet data extraction capability
- No backup/recovery functionality
- No private key exposure
- Replace-only wallet updates

### 1.4 Out of Scope
- Wallet creation (handled by external tools)
- Seed phrase management
- Wallet backup functionality
- Wallet recovery operations
- Private key extraction
- Wallet data export
- User authentication (handled by auth service)
- Fund management and transfers
- Strategy allocation
