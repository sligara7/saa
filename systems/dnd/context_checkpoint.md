- Mark implementation_status as existing/recommended/hypothetical
- Include source_verification for all interfaces

## Refresh Protocol Completed âœ“
- Architectural definitions pending initial load
- Template requirements documented
- System context established
- Progress tracking initialized through process_log.md
