# Process Improvements for Architecture Development

## Context Management Issues

### Problem
The step-by-step workflow was not consistently visible in the LLM's context window, leading to:
- Forgetting to check the workflow between steps
- Missing validation steps
- Potential inconsistencies in architecture decisions

### Solution
1. Implement mandatory context refresh checkpoints:
   - Before starting each major step
   - Every 5-7 service files
   - Every 15-20 minutes of processing
   - When context degradation is detected

2. Create context management files:
   - process_log.md: Track decisions and progress
   - working_memory.json: Store current state
   - context_checkpoint.md: Condensed critical context

## Architecture Validation Issues

### Current Issues
1. Circular Dependencies:
   - story_engine â†” plot_generator bidirectional dependency
   - Both depend on branch_manager
   - Risk of initialization and deployment issues

2. Resource Sharing:
   - Multiple services using PostgreSQL 18
   - Shared AI Content Generator
   - No clear resource isolation boundaries

3. Interface Consistency:
   - Similar endpoints across services (/adapt, /generate)
   - No central interface registry
   - Potential for interface drift

### Recommended Improvements

1. Dependency Resolution:
   - Make branch_manager the central source of truth
   - Route plot_generator requests through story_engine
   - Implement clear ownership of state transitions

2. Resource Isolation:
   - Create separate databases per service
   - Implement resource coordinator service
   - Add clear resource access patterns

3. Interface Management:
   - Create central interface registry
   - Implement consistent versioning strategy
   - Add interface validation steps

## Required System Tracking

### Issue
The workflow lost track of required systems that were identified during initial analysis but not immediately created. Empty system directories were incorrectly treated as unnecessary rather than incomplete.

### Solution
1. **System Requirement Tracking:**
   - Log all identified required systems in working_memory.json
   - Track system status (identified, created, validated)
   - Regular validation that all required systems exist

2. **Directory Validation Enhancement:**
   - Check system requirements against feature summary
   - Validate dependencies between systems
   - Ensure all required systems have architecture files
   - Warning for empty directories of required systems

3. **Feature Summary Integration:**
   - Parse feature summary for system requirements
   - Map identified features to required systems
   - Track feature-to-system coverage

### Implementation
```json
// working_memory.json system tracking
{
  "required_systems": [
    {
      "system_id": "search_discovery_system",
      "feature_section": "6. Search & Discovery",
      "status": "identified",
      "dependencies": ["integration_system"],
      "created_at": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Process Checklist Enhancement

### Pre-Step Validation
- [ ] Review step-by-step workflow
- [ ] Check architectural definitions
- [ ] Verify current working directory
- [ ] Load templates and schemas
- [ ] Review previous decisions

### Post-Step Validation
- [ ] Verify file creation success
- [ ] Validate against schemas
- [ ] Check interface consistency
- [ ] Update central registry
- [ ] Document decisions made

## RAG Integration
- Add specific RAG queries for:
  - Architecture patterns
  - Interface design
  - Security best practices
  - Deployment strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement context refresh protocol
2. Create interface registry
3. Add validation checkpoints
4. Resolve circular dependencies
5. Implement resource isolation
