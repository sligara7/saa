# Step-by-Step: LLM-Driven Translation of System Descriptions to Service JSON Objects (System-Agnostic)



## Overview: System-Agnostic, LLM-Driven Decomposition and JSON Representation

This process is designed to be agnostic to the domain, language, or granularity of the system being analyzed. It can be applied to:
- Software codebases (from individual functions/packages to high-level services)
- Systems-of-systems (e.g., distributed architectures, warfighting systems, biological systems)
- Any complex system where components ("nodes") and their interfaces ("edges") can be described

The only requirement is that the system can be described in text (free-form, markdown, structured docs, etc.). The LLM agent is responsible for decomposing, structuring, and serializing the system into a set of JSON objects representing each component and its interfaces, ready for further analysis (e.g., with NetworkX or other tools).

**Final Objective:** Create a **water-tight set of individual `service_architecture.json` files** where each service can be built/developed independently with **guaranteed integration success**. By performing comprehensive due diligence on functions (SRDs) and interfaces (ICDs) upfront, we ensure that when individual teams develop their services according to these specifications, the system will integrate seamlessly without interface conflicts or missing dependencies.




### LLM-Human Partnered, Graph-Based Process
This process leverages an LLM agent and human collaboration to:
- Accept any human-provided input, including:
   - Individual SRDs/ICDs for each component, service, or package (in any format)
   - A high-level system description, architectural goal, or system-of-systems overview (free-form text, markdown, etc.)
- Decompose the system into individual components/services (nodes) and their interfaces (edges) if not already done
- Draft or parse SRDs (system requirements) and ICDs (interface control) for each component/service
- **Build a global system graph to infer all end-to-end paths and interfaces across the entire system**
- **Update all relevant service artifacts in coordinated batches to ensure consistency and completeness**
- Use a domain-appropriate template (e.g., SAA `base_models.py` for software) to build structured objects (e.g., `BaseSRD`, `BaseICD`, `ServiceArchitecture`)
- Serialize each component/service as a JSON file (with versioning) in its folder, designed for both machine-actionability and human readability
- Support both bottom-up (component-by-component) and top-down (system goal) engineering workflows
- Optionally, allow for a high-level architecture object (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.json`) to capture system-wide goals, constraints, or integration intent





### Detailed Steps (as performed in this project)

1. **Human Input**
   - The human provides either:
     - A high-level system description (text, markdown, etc.)
     - Or, a set of individual SRDs/ICDs for each component/service (in any format)



2. **LLM-Human Partnered, Batch-Oriented Path Inference and Interface Deduction (Graph-Based)**
   - The LLM agent and human partner collaborate to:
      - Decompose the system into components/services (nodes) and their interfaces (edges), using all available documentation.
      - Draft or parse SRDs and ICDs for each component/service.
   - **Batch Path Inference:**
      - Build a global directed graph (e.g., with NetworkX) representing all services and their dependencies/interfaces.
      - Infer all end-to-end communication paths and required interfaces for the entire system using efficient graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc.).
      - Store deduced interfaces and message formats in a central registry or mapping.
   - **Coordinated Artifact Update:**
      - For each inferred path or interface, update all relevant `service_architecture.json` files for the involved services in a single coordinated batch, ensuring consistency and completeness.
      - The format and content of messages/data must be consistent across all services in a path, unless a transformation is explicitly specified at an intermediate service.
      - Use the central registry to synchronize updates and avoid redundant or inconsistent changes.
   - **Human-LLM Review Loop:**
      - Artifacts (`service_architecture.json` files and the global graph) are designed to be both machine-actionable (for LLMs/automation) and human-readable (for review, collaboration, and traceability).
      - The human can review, edit, or annotate artifacts at any stage, and the LLM agent can incorporate feedback in the next batch update.
   - **Result:**
      - The process produces a set of **water-tight JSON artifacts** where each service specification is complete and unambiguous.
      - Each `service_architecture.json` contains all necessary information for independent development: complete functional requirements (SRD), validated interface contracts (ICD), and all deduced dependencies.
      - The artifacts are both machine-actionable (for LLMs/automation) and human-readable (for review, collaboration, and traceability).
      - **Independent Development Guarantee:** Teams can develop services independently according to their specifications, with confidence that system integration will succeed because all interface contracts have been validated and coordinated.

3. **Parse High-Level Architecture Constraints (Preparation for Analysis):**
    - Read and parse `ARCHITECTURE.json` (or equivalent) for global system constraints and requirements
    - Represent high-level architecture goals as a structured object/JSON if provided
    - Prepare constraint validation rules for the automated analysis phase
    - **Purpose:** These constraints will be used in step 4 to identify compliance violations and architectural mismatches

4. **Translate to Structured Objects (Post-Interface Deduction)**
   - Use a domain-appropriate template (e.g., SAA's `base_models.py` for software)
   - For each component/service, create a structured object (e.g., `ServiceArchitecture` for software, or a domain-appropriate equivalent)
   - Include all deduced interfaces and message formats from the coordinated batch inference process

5. **Persist as JSON and Update Index**
   - Serialize each structured object to a JSON file (e.g., `service_architecture.json`) in the component/service's folder
   - Include a `version` field using semver-date versioning (e.g., `1.0+2025-09-28`)
   - **Automatically update a central JSON index file (e.g., `service_architecture_index.json`) with the absolute path to each `service_architecture.json` as it is created.**
   - The index must store the correct, directly usable absolute path for each file, so that downstream scripts can reliably access the artifacts without ambiguity or path errors.
   - If working with an existing codebase, retroactively scan and populate this index file to ensure all service JSONs are tracked with their absolute paths.

6. **Artifacts**
   - JSON files for each component/service's combined SRD/ICD object (with versioning and deduced interfaces)
   - In-memory structured objects for each component/service
   - A global system graph (e.g., NetworkX DiGraph) with all services and their interfaces
   - **A central `service_architecture_index.json` file mapping each service to the absolute path of its JSON artifact (must be correct and directly usable by all scripts)**
   - A central interface registry or mapping for consistency validation
   - Parsed system constraints from `ARCHITECTURE.json` or equivalent (if provided)
   - All artifacts designed for both machine-actionability (LLM processing) and human readability (review and collaboration)

7. **Final Deliverable: Water-Tight Service Specifications for Independent Development**
   - **Complete Service Specifications:** Each `service_architecture.json` file contains everything needed for independent development:
      - Comprehensive functional requirements (SRD)
      - Validated interface contracts with exact message formats and protocols (ICD)
      - All required dependencies and their interface specifications
      - Security, performance, and compliance requirements
   - **Integration Guarantee:** Because all interfaces have been coordinated and validated across the entire system:
      - Services developed according to their specifications will integrate without interface conflicts
      - Message formats are consistent across all communication paths
      - All required intermediate interfaces have been identified and specified
      - Dependencies are complete and unambiguous
   - **Independent Development Ready:** Development teams can work in parallel on their services with confidence that the final system integration will succeed

## Sample LLM Prompt Template (System-Agnostic)


> **Prompt:**
> "You are a systems architect assistant partnering with a human to analyze a system-of-systems. Given the following system description or a set of SRDs/ICDs, build a global graph of all components/services and their interfaces. Infer all end-to-end communication paths and required intermediate interfaces using graph algorithms. Update all relevant service artifacts in coordinated batches to ensure message formats and interfaces are consistent across each path. Using a domain-appropriate template (e.g., SAA base_models.py for software), create structured objects for each component/service (e.g., ServiceArchitecture, BaseSRD, BaseICD). Serialize each as a JSON file with a version field in semver-date format (e.g., 1.0+2025-09-28). The artifacts should be both machine-actionable for LLM processing and human-readable for review. This process is system-agnostic and can be applied to software, hardware, biological, or other complex systems."

## What We've Done So Far (Project-Specific)

1. **Collected all SRDs and ICDs** for each service in `/examples/xrpl_example/`.
2. **Used the LLM agent to parse and structure** each SRD and ICD, then inferred end-to-end paths and deduced all required interfaces.
3. **Created a `ServiceArchitecture` object** (using SAA's `base_models.py`) for each service, combining its SRD and ICD with deduced interfaces.
4. **Updated all relevant service artifacts in coordinated batches** to ensure interface consistency and message format alignment across communication paths.
5. **Serialized each object as `service_architecture.json`** in the corresponding service folder, using semver-date versioning.
6. **Ensured the process is system-agnostic** and could be applied to any domain, not just Python or software.
7. **Ready for next steps:** network analysis, constraint checking, or system-wide integration using the generated JSON artifacts.

---

**Next Step:**
1. Use the LLM agent to perform the transformation from human input (system description or SRDs/ICDs) into structured JSON objects for each component/service, using a domain-appropriate template. **Build a global system graph, infer all end-to-end paths and interfaces, and update all relevant service artifacts in coordinated batches to ensure consistency.**


2. **Index and Visualize the Current System-of-Systems State:**
    - **Indexing:**
       - As each `service_architecture.json` is created, its absolute path is automatically recorded in a central `service_architecture_index.json` file (a mapping of service ID to absolute file path).
       - For existing projects, retroactively scan and populate this index file to ensure all service JSONs are tracked with their absolute paths.
       - This index enables efficient access for analysis and future updates, and eliminates the need for directory scanning in downstream scripts. The path must be correct and directly usable by all scripts.
    - **Graph Construction:**
       - Write a Python script that:
          - Loads all `service_architecture.json` files using the central index file.
          - Adds each service as a node in a NetworkX directed graph.
          - Adds edges for each dependency/interface (using the `dependencies` or `interfaces` fields).
          - Visualizes or outputs the resulting system-of-systems graph.
    - **Purpose:**
       - This step captures the current state of the system as it is, before any system-level constraints or future-state goals are applied.
       - The graph supports analysis such as:
          - Identifying orphaned nodes/edges (services with no connections)
          - Detecting duplicative or overlapping functions
          - Highlighting missing or ambiguous interfaces
          - Enabling further constraint or gap analysis

3. **Parse System-Level Constraints and Prepare for Automated Analysis:**
    - If a system-level architecture file (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.json` or equivalent) is present:
       - Parse and extract global constraints, rules, and requirements.
       - Prepare these constraints for automated validation in the next step.
    - **Note:**
       - The `service_architecture.json` files represent the current state, which will be analyzed for compliance with these constraints.
       - The automated analysis will identify where the current state deviates from desired constraints and goals.

4. **Automated Analysis and Risk/Gap Identification:**
    - **Phase 1: Identify Issues Using Graph Analysis:**
       - Use NetworkX graph algorithms and machine-readable artifacts to automatically detect:
          - **Orphaned nodes/services** (no incoming or outgoing connections)
          - **Circular dependencies** (cycles in the dependency graph)
          - **Single points of failure** (critical nodes whose removal disconnects the graph)
          - **Interface mismatches** (inconsistent message formats across communication paths)
          - **Missing intermediate interfaces** (gaps in end-to-end communication paths)
          - **Duplicative functions** (services with overlapping purposes or interfaces)
          - **Security vulnerabilities** (unencrypted or unauthenticated communication paths)
          - **Performance bottlenecks** (high-degree nodes that could become bottlenecks)
          - **Compliance violations** (services not meeting specified constraints from ARCHITECTURE.json)
       - Generate a machine-readable **issues report** (JSON format) categorizing all detected problems by severity and type
       - Provide human-readable **visualization and summary** highlighting problem areas in the system graph
    
    - **Phase 2: Generate and Implement Remedies:**
       - **Automated Remedy Suggestions:**
          - For each identified issue, use LLM analysis to propose specific remedies (e.g., "Add authentication to HTTP interface between service_A and service_B")
          - Rank remedies by impact, implementation complexity, and risk reduction
          - Generate updated `service_architecture.json` files that implement the proposed remedies
       - **Human-LLM Collaboration:**
          - Present issues and proposed remedies to the human for review and approval
          - Allow human to modify, reject, or prioritize remedies before implementation
          - Update the system graph and service artifacts to reflect approved changes
       - **Validation:**
          - Re-run the analysis on the updated system to verify that issues have been resolved
          - Ensure no new issues were introduced by the remedies
          - **Final Verification:** Confirm that each service specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for independent development
          - **Integration Assurance:** Validate that all interface contracts are consistent and will enable seamless system integration
    
    - **Artifacts:**
       - **Issues report** (JSON) with detailed analysis of all detected problems
       - **Remedies report** (JSON) with proposed solutions and implementation plans
       - **Updated service_architecture.json files** implementing approved remedies
       - **Updated system graph** reflecting the improved architecture
       - **Validation report** confirming issue resolution
