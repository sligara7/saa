For this system of systems, consider "mass" as systems (nodes), and "energy" as the interfaces/edges between systems.  Then the E = MC^2 is a fundamental equation.

High-level system of systems
The universe can be viewed as a large, evolving system of systems, where each level of organization—from the subatomic to the supergalactic—is a complex system in its own right. 
System 1: The fundamental forces system
Function: Governs all interactions between matter and energy.
Subsystems:
Gravity: Regulates the motion of planets, stars, and galaxies. It is the driving force behind the formation of large-scale structures like galaxy clusters and superclusters.
Electromagnetism: Governs the behavior of atoms, molecules, and light. It dictates chemical reactions, the structure of matter, and all electrical and magnetic phenomena.
Strong nuclear force: Binds atomic nuclei together, ensuring the stability of matter.
Weak nuclear force: Responsible for certain types of radioactive decay, such as beta decay. 
System 2: The matter and energy system
Function: Constitutes the physical content of the universe and its state.
Subsystems:
Ordinary (Baryonic) Matter:
Function: Forms visible structures like stars, planets, and gas clouds.
Components: Protons, neutrons, and electrons.
Dark Matter:
Function: Provides the extra gravitational cohesion needed to hold galaxies and clusters together.
Components: Non-baryonic particles that do not interact with light.
Dark Energy:
Function: Drives the accelerated expansion of the universe at the largest scales.
Components: A mysterious form of energy whose nature is unknown. 
System 3: The cosmic structure system
Function: Organizes and arranges matter into increasingly large configurations.
Subsystems:
Stellar and Planetary Systems:
Function: Processes matter and energy, supporting complex internal dynamics.
Components: Stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.
Galaxies:
Function: Aggregates stellar and planetary systems into gravitationally bound collections.
Components: Stars, stellar systems, gas, dust, and dark matter halos.
Galaxy Clusters and Superclusters:
Function: Arranges galaxies into larger, gravitationally interacting groups.
Components: Galaxy groups, clusters, and vast regions of hot intracluster gas.
Cosmic Web:
Function: Forms the largest known organization of matter, creating filaments and voids across the universe.
Components: Galaxy clusters, superclusters, and the intergalactic medium. 
System integration and emergent properties
In this model, integration is not a designed process but a consequence of the fundamental laws of physics.
Integration mechanism: The interaction of gravity from the Fundamental Forces System with matter from the Matter and Energy System drives the self-organization seen in the Cosmic Structure System.
Emergent properties: The collaborative and dynamic interplay of these systems and subsystems gives rise to emergent phenomena that are greater than the sum of their parts. Examples include:
The complex dynamics of a galaxy.
The expansion of spacetime itself, resulting from the combined effects of dark energy and matter. 
Process considerations
Applying systems engineering principles to the universe highlights the following challenges:
Verification and validation: We cannot build, test, or validate the universe's design against requirements. Validation relies on observing the current state of the universe and inferring the underlying processes.
Requirements traceability: Tracing the properties of a supercluster back to the quantum fluctuations of the Big Bang is one of the grand challenges of modern cosmology.
Evolutionary development: The universe exhibits evolutionary development, not through design iterations, but through the long-term, self-organizing effects of physical laws.
