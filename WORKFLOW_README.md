# Streamlined Architecture Workflow System

## Overview

This directory contains a **completely refactored, machine-readable architecture workflow** designed for efficient LLM agent execution. The original 1365-line markdown document has been transformed into a streamlined JSON-based system with clear execution guides and visual references.

## Problem Solved

The original `step_by_step_architecture_process.md` had grown too large and complex through multiple iterations, creating challenges:
- **Context overload**: LLM agents struggled with finite context windows
- **Process drift**: Easy to lose track of objectives during complex operations
- **Unclear decision points**: Decision flows embedded in prose rather than structured
- **Manual tracking**: No automated context management
- **Duplication**: Repeated instructions throughout the document

## Solution Components

### 1. **architecture_workflow.json** (Primary Specification)
Machine-readable workflow definition containing:
- **10 workflow steps** (0-9) with clear actions and validation
- **Context management protocol** with automatic refresh triggers
- **Decision flows** for hierarchy classification, decomposition, and validation
- **Tool references** with exact commands and usage guidance
- **Quick reference** section for rapid context restoration

**Size**: 784 lines (vs 1365 original)  
**Structure**: Pure JSON, parseable by any tool  
**Usage**: Load this file for workflow execution

### 2. **LLM_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md** (Execution Strategy)
Concise guide explaining how an LLM agent should execute the workflow:
- **Core execution protocol**: What to do before every operation
- **Context refresh protocol**: When and how to refresh
- **Step-by-step summaries**: Goals and key actions for each step
- **Decision flows**: Clear branching logic
- **Tool usage**: Quick reference commands
- **Emergency recovery**: What to do when lost
- **FAQ**: Common questions and answers

**Size**: 375 lines  
**Focus**: How to execute, not what to execute  
**Usage**: Read this first, then execute architecture_workflow.json

### 3. **WORKFLOW_VISUAL.md** (Visual Reference)
ASCII diagrams and decision trees showing:
- **Process flow diagram**: Complete workflow from start to finish
- **Context refresh cycle**: Visualization of refresh protocol
- **Decision trees**: Hierarchy classification, Level 3 decomposition, validation failure
- **Step 8 iteration pattern**: How to handle complex substeps
- **Tracking files relationships**: How context files interact

**Size**: 582 lines  
**Focus**: Visual understanding at a glance  
**Usage**: Reference when uncertain about process flow

### 4. **step_by_step_architecture_process.md** (Original - Preserved)
The original comprehensive document has been preserved for reference but is **no longer the primary execution specification**.

**Status**: Reference only  
**Usage**: Consult for deep dives into rationale and background

# 1. Verify prerequisites
ls -la /home/ajs7/project/saa/architecture_workflow.json
ls -la /home/ajs7/project/saa/LLM_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md
ls -la /home/ajs7/project/saa/WORKFLOW_VISUAL.md

# 2. Read execution guide
cat /home/ajs7/project/saa/LLM_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md

# 3. Load workflow specification
cat /home/ajs7/project/saa/architecture_workflow.json
```

### Starting a New System Analysis
```bash
# 1. Execute Step 0 from architecture_workflow.json
# 2. Create system directory: /home/ajs7/project/saa/systems/<system_name>
# 3. Initialize tracking files
# 4. Follow workflow from Step 1 onwards
```

### Resuming Existing Work
```bash
# 1. READ: systems/<system_name>/current_focus.md (ALWAYS FIRST)
# 2. CHECK: systems/<system_name>/step_progress_tracker.json
# 3. VERIFY: operations_since_refresh <= 4
# 4. CONTINUE with next action from current_focus.md
```

## Key Improvements

### Context Management
**Before**:
- Manual context refresh reminders scattered throughout document
- No clear triggers or counters
- Degradation detection implied but not systematic

**After**:
- **Automatic triggers**: Operation count >= 4, time >= 12 minutes, step transitions
- **Systematic tracking**: step_progress_tracker.json with operation counter
- **Clear refresh sequence**: 8-step protocol (PAUSE → SAVE → RELOAD → READ → CONFIRM → RESET → RESUME)
- **Degradation signals**: 6 explicit detection criteria

### Decision Clarity
**Before**:
- Decision points embedded in paragraph text
- Branching logic unclear
- Objective triggers described but not structured

**After**:
- **Decision flows**: Separate JSON section with clear options
- **Visual decision trees**: ASCII diagrams showing all branches
- **Objective triggers**: 6 explicit, testable criteria for Level 3 decomposition
- **Validation failure actions**: Mapped response for each failure type

### Tool Usage
**Before**:
- Tool commands scattered throughout steps
- Usage context unclear
- No centralized reference

**After**:
- **Tool reference section**: Centralized in JSON workflow

- **Usage triggers**: When to use each tool
- **Quick reference**: Condensed commands in execution guide

### Tracking and Recovery
**Before**:
- Tracking files mentioned but format not specified
- Recovery protocol implicit
- Progress tracking manual

**After**:
- **5 tracking files**: Explicit formats and purposes

## Context Management Strategy

### The Problem: Finite Context Windows
LLM agents have limited context windows. Long, complex processes cause:
1. **Context drift**: Forgetting initial objectives
2. **Repeated mistakes**: Not learning from earlier in the conversation
3. **Process derailment**: Getting lost and unable to continue

### The Solution: Systematic Refresh Protocol

```
Every 4 operations OR 12 minutes OR step transition:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 1. PAUSE                            │
  │ 2. SAVE current state               │
  │ 3. RELOAD foundations & templates   │
  │ 4. RELOAD workflow.json             │
  │ 5. READ current_focus.md            │
  │ 6. CONFIRM understanding            │
  │ 7. RESET operation counter          │
  │ 8. RESUME with fresh context        │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Innovation: current_focus.md
Before every operation, LLM agent reads `systems/<system_name>/current_focus.md` which states:
- **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION**: Exactly what to do right now
- **CURRENT CONTEXT**: System name, step, substep, progress
- **WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW**: Step-by-step instructions
- **DO NOT FORGET**: Critical reminders

This single file keeps the agent on track even with limited context.

## Workflow Execution Pattern

### Normal Operation (Operations 1-3)
```
Operation → Update tracker → Continue → Operation → Update tracker → Continue
```

### Operation 4 (Refresh Trigger)
```
Operation → REFRESH TRIGGERED → PAUSE → SAVE → RELOAD → CONFIRM → RESUME
```

### After Refresh (Operation 5+)
```
Operation (counter reset) → Continue...
```

This creates a **heartbeat pattern** that prevents context drift.

## Decision Flow Examples

### Example 1: Hierarchy Classification (Step 1)
```
INPUT: "Build a web application with React frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database"

ANALYSIS: This is an Individual System (not a System-of-Systems, not just a Component)

DECISION: Decompose to:
  - Level 1: Frontend, Backend, Database (Major Components)
  - Level 2: React components, API routes, DB tables (Submodules)

NEXT: Proceed to Step 2 with this hierarchy
```

### Example 2: Level 3 Decomposition Trigger (Step 2.2)
```
INTERFACE: "authentication_service ↔ user_management_service"

CHECK TRIGGERS:
  ✓ Interface marked 'recommended' with no existing implementation
  ✓ Interface is security critical (authentication)
  
DECISION: ANY trigger met → Proceed to Level 3 decomposition

ACTION:
  - Request source code for authentication_service
  - Identify specific classes/methods handling interface
  - Create Level 3 service_architecture.json for AuthHandler class
```

### Example 3: Validation Failure (Step 6)
```
VALIDATION: Graph consistency check failed - circular dependency detected

ISSUE: service_a → service_b → service_c → service_a

DECISION: Graph cycle detected

ACTION:
  - Introduce message queue between service_c and service_a
  - Update service_architecture.json for both services
  - Change direct dependency to event-driven pattern
  - Re-run system_of_systems_graph.py
  - Verify cycle resolved
```

## Migration from Original Document

If you have existing work based on the original `step_by_step_architecture_process.md`:

1. **No immediate action required**: Original document preserved for reference
2. **Gradual migration**: Use new workflow for new systems
3. **Mapping available**: Steps in JSON workflow correspond to original document steps
4. **Enhanced, not replaced**: New system adds structure, doesn't change fundamentals

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what to do next"
→ Read `systems/<system_name>/current_focus.md`

### "I forgot which step I'm on"
→ Read `systems/<system_name>/step_progress_tracker.json`

### "I forgot the system name"
→ This is a degradation signal. Execute context refresh immediately.

### "Validation failed, what now?"
→ Check `decision_flows.validation_failure` in architecture_workflow.json

### "How do I run tool X?"
→ Check `tool_reference` section in architecture_workflow.json

### "I'm completely lost"
→ Execute emergency recovery protocol in LLM_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md
