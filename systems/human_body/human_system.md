1. Skeletal system
Primary function: Provides structural support, protection for internal organs, and the framework for muscle attachment and movement. It also produces blood cells and stores minerals.
Components: Bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. 
2. Muscular system
Primary function: Enables movement (locomotion and manipulation), maintains posture, and produces heat.
Components: Three types of muscle tissue:
Skeletal muscles: Attached to bones to facilitate conscious movement.
Smooth muscles: Found in the walls of internal organs and blood vessels, controlling involuntary actions.
Cardiac muscle: Forms the heart and pumps blood. 
3. Nervous system
Primary function: Acts as the body's control and communication network, processing sensory information and coordinating all body activities.
Components:
Central Nervous System (CNS): The brain and spinal cord.
Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): Nerves and sensory organs that extend from the CNS to the rest of the body. 
4. Endocrine system
Primary function: Regulates metabolic processes, growth, and sexual development by producing and secreting hormones.
Components: Endocrine glands, including the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, ovaries, and testes. 
5. Cardiovascular (or Circulatory) system
Primary function: Transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body.
Components: The heart, blood, and blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). 
6. Lymphatic system
Primary function: Defends the body against infection and disease, drains excess fluids from tissues, and recycles proteins back into the blood.
Components: Lymph, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen, and thymus. 
7. Respiratory system
Primary function: Responsible for gas exchange, bringing oxygen into the body and expelling carbon dioxide.
Components: The nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. 
8. Digestive system
Primary function: Breaks down food into smaller molecules for the absorption of nutrients and removes solid waste.
Components: The gastrointestinal tract (mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, and anus) and accessory organs (liver, gallbladder, and pancreas). 
9. Urinary (or Excretory/Renal) system
Primary function: Filters blood to produce urine, removes liquid waste, and maintains fluid and electrolyte balance.
Components: Kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. 
10. Integumentary system
Primary function: Forms the body's external protective covering, regulates temperature, and houses sensory receptors.
Components: The skin, hair, and nails. 
11. Reproductive system
Primary function: Produces sex cells and hormones necessary for reproduction.
Components:
Male: Testes, penis, and other associated organs.
Female: Ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. 
Inter-system dependencies for modeling
In a systems engineering model, it is crucial to account for the dependencies and feedback loops between these systems. A disturbance in one system will create a cascade of effects throughout the model. For instance: 
The Nervous and Endocrine systems work together to control nearly all body processes.
The Respiratory and Cardiovascular systems are tightly coupled, as the respiratory system provides the oxygen that the cardiovascular system transports.
The Urinary system filters blood supplied by the Cardiovascular system and works to remove waste products.
The Skeletal and Muscular systems form the musculoskeletal system, which provides movement and support.
